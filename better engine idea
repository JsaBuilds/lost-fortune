each room is defined by a Room class, and is given a unique ID tag.

For example:

                         ID tag
                         V
    forest_copse1 = Room("fcopse1", ... options and items, etc. )

Options could be paired with other Room IDs:


    gross_swamp3 = Room("gswamp3", ("Go left", "gswamp4"), ("Go right", "gswamp5"), ... four options, items, etc. )

Then, when a room is loaded into the game, its option tuplets will be loaded in as well.

The option menu can display the first item in the tuplet.

When a player chooses an option, the game thus loads the room with the same ID that matches
the second item of the tuplet.

---

There is a database that lists all the items in the game.

Item class with ID, inventory title, scene desc (what to say about item in the scene),
Room it is located in, if it has been collected:

    swamp_stick = Room("stick1", "Muddy Stick", "A muddy stick lies in the bog.", "gswamp5", false)

when a new room is loaded into the game (via it's ID), the items' ID's are checked.
If an item's ID matches the room ID and it has not been collected, it may be added
to the game's list of current_items and displayed in the item section of the menu.

When a player chooses to pick up an item, the game looks through its list of current_items
(which items have IDs that match the current Room ID). If that item has not been picked up,
the game adds the item to the player's inventory and sets that item's collected status to true.
Then the menu is redisplayed to tell the player the item was collected.

Picking up an item means the player types "B", then the scene title of the item. It will have to be
a list. ex: ["stick", "Stick", "Thick Stick", ...]

The item will have a different variable indicating the inventory title: what displays in the inventory.
Inventory title will be 10 characters. ex: "ThickStick"
