each room is defined by a Room class, and is given a unique ID tag.

For example:

                         ID tag
                         V
    forest_copse1 = Room("fcopse1", ... options and items, etc. )

Options could be paired with other Room IDs:


    gross_swamp3 = Room("gswamp3", ("Go left", "gswamp4"), ("Go right", "gswamp5"), ... four options, items, etc. )

Then, when a room is loaded into the game, its option tuplets will be loaded in as well.

The option menu can display the first item in the tuplet.

When a player chooses an option, the game thus loads the room with the same ID that matches
the second item of the tuplet.

---

There is a database that lists all the items in the game.

Item class with ID, inventory title, scene desc (what to say about item in the scene), and
Room it is located in:

    swamp_stick = Room("stick1", "Muddy Stick", "A muddy stick lies in the bog.", "gswamp5")
